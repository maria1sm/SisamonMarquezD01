# Flutter Project 01 - SisamonMarquezD01

This Flutter project aims to **create a replica** following the given instructions. The main objectives are as follows:

### Project Structure

- **Folder Organization:** Widgets are organized into separate folders for better code structure and maintainability.
- **Avoid Infinite Widget Trees:** Care has been taken to avoid creating an infinite tree of widgets.

### Counter
- The counter must start at zero.
- It must not go below 0 (no negative numbers).
- Create a blue background for the counter screen.
- Both parts have to match the height of the screen measurements.

### Widgets Exploration

Additional widgets not covered in class have been incorporated, and their usage has been researched on the [official Flutter documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/):
